"""Leetcode 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
Hard

URL:

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting
node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must
contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
       1
      / \
     2   3
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Output: 42
